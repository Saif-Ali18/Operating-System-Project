# SJF and Round Robin Comparative Analyzer

This is a Python-based simulation project that compares two popular CPU scheduling algorithms: **Shortest Job First (SJF)** and **Round Robin (RR)**. The comparison is based on metrics such as **CPU utilization**, **throughput**, **average waiting time**, **turnaround time**, and **context switches**.

---

## üîç Objectives

- Simulate the working of SJF and RR scheduling algorithms.
- Compare their performance under different conditions.
- Understand OS concepts like **scheduling**, **memory management**, and **inter-process communication (IPC)**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- üêç Python 3.x
- VS Code (or any Python IDE)
- Optional: Shell script for automation or simulation

---

## üìä Features

- Accepts dynamic input of processes (arrival time, burst time, etc.)
- Supports **time quantum** input for Round Robin.
- Calculates:
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - CPU Utilization
  - Throughput
  - Number of Context Switches
- Displays comparative results of SJF vs RR.
- Optional graph/chart support using `matplotlib`.

## üß† OS Concepts Covered

- Scheduling Algorithms (SJF and Round Robin)
- Memory Management (Simulated memory allocation)
- Inter-Process Communication (using shared variables, pipes, or files)
